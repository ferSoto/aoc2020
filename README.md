# Advent of Code 2020

On December 2020 I tried to learn Kotlin by participating in the AoC. Nevertheless, I dropped the challenge on the 8th day (the same day as I dropped it in 2021 ðŸ˜…).

On January 2022 I found out that the Jetbrains' folks published Kotlin-idiomatic solutions for the AoC 2020 and I realized that my attempt in 2020 was not even close to be kotlin idiomatic, so here I am, reviving the repo and retrying the challenge but now trying to do all the exercises following the Kotlin way - whatever that means.

The old attempts were moved to [./deprecated](deprecated) in case you're curious of what I tried back in 2020.
