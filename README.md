# Advent of Code 2020

AoC [website](https://adventofcode.com/) for more info.

My attempt to participate in this year AoC. This time, instead of focusing on performance, I want to use the problems to practice/learn kotlin.

In order to do that, I'm using Kotlin for scripting (.kts files).

To run the scripts use

```bash
$ kotlinc -script path/to/script.kts < path/to/input.txt
```

See docs to setup [Scripting Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html).
